# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on predicting sentiment analysis based on tweets using machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook h8dsft_P2M2_Gentur_Herlambang.ipynb contains the detailed steps taken to preprocess, model, and evaluate the Twitter sentiment dataset.


# Introduction
Twitter sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for understanding public opinion, brand sentiment, and user feedback. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. By accurately predicting the sentiment, businesses, researchers, and individuals can gain valuable insights from large volumes of Twitter data.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is available at Twitter Sentiment Dataset. It contains a collection of tweets along with their corresponding sentiment labels, indicating whether the tweet is positive, negative, or neutral.

# Key Steps
The project involves the following key steps:

- Data Preprocessing: Perform data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning the text, removing noise, handling special characters, and converting text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings to represent the tweets numerically.
- Model Building: Build a machine learning model, such as a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, Naive Bayes, or support vector machines), to predict the sentiment of tweets based on the extracted features.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Prediction and Insights: Use the trained model to make predictions on new tweets and analyze the results to gain insights into the sentiment patterns and trends.
